This charming little app uses the Web Audio API and a web worker to provide a reliable timing signal. Check out the demo here - [http://audio.grid](http://legal-deer.surge.sh)

Inspired by the scheduling pattern Chris Wilson shows here in [metronome](https://github.com/cwilso/metronome/blob/master/js/metronome.js).

The project does not really require redux (its over kill) but this is an educational project and my apprentices need to practice wiring up redux, so I have used it in this project.
